# Celebrating Women :princess:

All industries across the board have seen less number of female participants over the years and we are here to make a positive change to it. In an attempt to highlight and support these `Women of Impact`, we created an NFT marketplace where people could mint collectibles that celebrate and support their achievements. Supporters can then buy these collectibles and join the crypto fandom, who in turn receive rewards :stars: 

Concordium wallet is used to ensure only the real MVPs are the ones who are allowed to mint collectible in our marketplace. The minting of the collectibles are done by the `cis2-multi` set of contracts and the list of tokens can be seen in the following format.

The collectibles are transferable so that new fans do not face any entry barrier when they trying to support their favourites.

These tokens when minted are listed in the market place contract and are for the fans to buy and start supporting. A reward system is embedded to it with which we can gain rewards. These rewards can vary from merch or a live wrokshop with these leaders. The rewards are decided based on how many tokens are bought by the fans.

For the market place, the code is present in the `marketplace-contract` directory. Once we have successfully added our collectibles to the market, they are listed like below.
